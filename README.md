This is a Simple ML/DL which is used for Object Detection using ML algorithms.

This project contains a simple UI and UX with Sql_lite for sign-up and log-in.
Roboflow is used for the pre-processing of the data and the api is used o fetch the dataset.
And deployed in the roboflow only, where we use the API to fetch the trained model in the FastAPI.

Flask is used for the Backend.

It is a ML/DL based project which has used YOLOv5, YOLOv8 and YOLOv9 models for the detection of image.
We have used 5 classes for training ie Aloevera, Neem, Lemon, Mint and Tulsi.

YOLOv8 is a prefectly working with greater accuracy of about 97%.
YOLOv9 also has a accuracy of 97% but since it is still under the developer phase it gets confused between tulsi and mint.
YOLOv5 has a accuracy of 93% since it is a older version it gets lots of confused.
